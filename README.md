## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### Continued development

This project lacks some restructure of the CSS code, it feels like it's patched up and there are some directives that I yet do not fully understand (just that they work), so in future iterations and projects I will be sure to add:

- Media queries 
- Responsive units

### Useful resources

- [CSS Vertical Align (freecodecamp.org)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-vertical-align-how-to-center-a-div-text-or-an-image-example-code/) - Used the examples to center the div both horizontally and vertically with respect to the whole document
